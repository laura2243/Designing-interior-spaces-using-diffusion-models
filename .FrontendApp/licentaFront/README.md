### Background Video for Login and Register Pages

The background video used for both the login and register pages is too large to be included in the repository directly. To use it in the project, please follow these steps:

1. Download the video from the following link:  
   [Download Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hKiZwpePlF4LHZK8vuQyGhWuGZhE9bXx/view?usp=sharing)
   
2. Once downloaded, place the video file in the `src/assets` directory of your project.

By doing so, the video will be available as the background for both the login and register pages.
